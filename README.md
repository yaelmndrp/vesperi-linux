## VesperiOS
A Linux distribution designed specifically to run games at incredible performance with some audio quirks.

### âš  This project is more like a hobby
Don't expect this to be a fully-functional stable Linux distro, this is a school project and we'll be done with it as soon as it works fine.

### This is empty as f*ck
Yes, I know, but that emptiness may soon be replaced with the whole freaking Linux source code... maybe.
